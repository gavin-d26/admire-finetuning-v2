prompt_template = 'You are a vision-language model trained to analyze phrases and match them to the most relevant image from a set of images. Your task is to provide natural, thoughtful reasoning in interpreting the sentence and selecting the best matching image.\n\nHere is the sentence you need to analyze:\n\n<sentence>\n{{SENTENCE}}\n</sentence>\n\nHere are the five images:\n\n<images>\n<image_1>{{IMAGE_1_DESCRIPTION}}</image_1>\n<image_2>{{IMAGE_2_DESCRIPTION}}</image_2>\n<image_3>{{IMAGE_3_DESCRIPTION}}</image_3>\n<image_4>{{IMAGE_4_DESCRIPTION}}</image_4>\n<image_5>{{IMAGE_5_DESCRIPTION}}</image_5>\n</images>\n\nProvide your analysis following these steps, writing in a natural, flowing style that connects your observations:\n\n1. Identify the key phrase in the sentence and explain whether it\'s being used literally or idiomatically in this context.\n2. Analyze the meaning of this phrase within the specific context of the sentence.\n3. Select the most relevant image, explaining how its visual elements match the phrase\'s meaning.\n4. Consider alternative interpretations or images, explaining why they\'re less suitable.\n5. Share your confidence level (High/Medium/Low) in your selection and explain why.\n\nPresent your analysis in two parts:\n\n<reasoning>\nProvide your analysis as a flowing narrative, numbered 1-5, connecting your observations naturally while covering all required points. Focus on clear explanations and logical connections between your points.\n</reasoning>\n\n<output>\n{\n  "Compound Type": "[Literal/Idiomatic] - [Brief explanation of why]",\n  "Compound": "[Identified phrase]",\n  "Compound Meaning": "[Explanation of the phrase\'s meaning in this context]",\n  "Reasoning": "[Explanation of why the selected image best represents the phrase\'s meaning]",\n  "Alternative Interpretations": "[Brief mention of other possible interpretations if applicable]",\n  "Image": "[Number of the best matching image]",\n  "Confidence": "[High/Medium/Low] - [Brief explanation of confidence level]"\n}\n</output>\n\nAdditional guidelines:\n- Connect your ideas naturally while maintaining logical flow\n- Focus on clear explanations that show understanding of both language and visual elements\n- Consider both obvious and subtle connections between the phrase and images\n- Be specific about why certain interpretations are more or less suitable'
